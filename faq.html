<h3>What is a bike bus?</h3>
<p>A bike bus is a safe way for kids and families to ride their bikes to school by riding in a group.</p>
<p>We slow roll at the different stops to allow families to hop on the bike bus.</p>

<h3>How do we know if bike bus is cancelled?</h3>
<p>We ride every Friday that school's open, in rain, shine, &amp; snow, but <strong>not ice</strong>. Layer up!</p>
<p>If we don't have enough adult marshalls, we'll cancel the ride.</p>
<p>All cancellations will be posted by Thursday around 6pm on our social media.</p>
<p>Check our <a href="https://x.com/nettelhorstbike" class="secondary">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/nettelhorstbike">Instagram</a> for updates if the weather is looking risky.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for winter riding</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure your tires are not bald, and the pressure is good.</li>
  <li>Check your brakes!</li>
  <li>Many kiddos love wearing a balaclava to keep warm. These are warm, cheap, fit easily under helmets and available on places like Amazon.</li>
  <li>Wear a warm pair of gloves and/or bar mitts.</li>
  <li>Weatherproof shoes, and maybe some wool socks, can go a long way!</li>
</ul>
